Publish Workflow
================

The publish workflow of this CMS consists of the following 3 *stages*.  The
stage determines who can see the guide as well as where the guide appears on
the website front-end.

-----
Draft
-----

The initial stage where all guides start out in.  Guides in this stage are not
visible by anyone other than the original author. [1]

---------
In-review
---------

The second stage were guides go that are ready for community editing help.  Any
user can mark their guide as 'in-review' from dropdown at the bottom of the
guide page.

Guides should only be marked as 'in-review' when they are complete and ready
editing help.

**Please don't mark partially completed guides as in-review.** This will
necessarily waste community editors time reviewing guides that are not
completed.

Guides marked as 'in-review' will show up on the 'Review' page.

---------
Published
---------

The final stage for fully edited articles is published.  This is the stage
where the community editors have decided a guide is ready for the world to see.
Only community editors can move a guide into the published stage.

Published articles will be available on the homepage of the site.
